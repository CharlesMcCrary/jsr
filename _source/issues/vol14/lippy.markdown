These essays honor distinguished historian David Edwin Harrell Jr.,
longtime member of the Auburn University faculty, known to colleagues
simply as Ed. Some chapters appeared as conference papers as sessions
marking Ed's retirement. The four comprising the first section focus on
Ed's scholarship. The three in the second, all by former graduate
students of Ed, take concerns in his work in fresh directions. A
foreword by Wayne Flynt, preface by Grant Wacker, and epilog by Beth
Barton Schweiger complete the volume.

Some themes link the first four essays together. All praise Harrell's
work for its meticulous scholarship and attention to detail. Ed left no
page unread nor source ignored. Because of this thorough research, Ed's
critical judgments were, these writers insist, fair and without bias,
even when Harrell was a player in events about which he wrote.

In addition, all note that Ed pulled off a feat few have duplicated: he
combined rigorous historical analysis with a deep religious faith, one
informed by the Stone-Campbell restorationist tradition, more
specifically by that associated with the ultra-conservative,
non-institutional Churches of Christ. When pressed, Ed readily affirmed
his commitment to the "Truth-with-a-capital-T" at the heart of this
restorationist impulse.

This passion for the Truth of the faith that "was once delivered unto
the saints" (Jude 3, KJV) may help explain the precision in Harrell's
scholarship. Discerning (and receiving) pure Truth demands accurate
translation, interpretation, and understanding of Scripture. Imprecision
hurls one into falsehood. It follows that attention to detail in
historical inquiry yields the fairest results. Faith and history are
thus united.

The opening essay by Sam Hill, another giant in crafting southern
religious history into its own disciplinary endeavor, ponders what whets
Harrell's scholarly appetite, observing (as do other writers) that
Harrell cultivated a sensitivity to phenomena on the margins of southern
religion, whether his own Churches of Christ, Pentecostal healing
evangelists, or sectarian movements that revealed ways race and social
class shaped the region's religious consciousness. Hill also notes the
American history survey text that Harrell co-authored with three others,
*Unto a Good Land: A History of the American People* (2005). In one sense,
this work may be Ed's most enduring achievement; it weaves the story of
religion and its influence into the fabric of American history. In
contrast, most survey texts ignore religion altogether.

James Goff, who studied with Harrell, emphasizes how Ed, although not
Pentecostal, wrote with sympathy and clarity about the healing revivals
in post-World War II Pentecostal and charismatic experience. Harrell
took seriously what others treated as exotica. In the more than four
decades since his *All Things Are Possible: The Healing and Charismatic
Revivals in Modern America* (1975) first appeared, trends have shown
Harrell right in his assessment of the importance and ascendancy of
Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity that now dominate Christian
life in some regions of the world. Goff also reviews Harrell's biography
of healing evangelist Oral Roberts (1985), whose theatrics brought scorn
and dismissal from both religious leaders and scholars. Harrell used
Roberts to illuminate the Pentecostal surge, crafting a model for
religious biography in the process.

Richard Hughes---another of restorationism's premier historians---explores
the skill with which Harrell probed that tradition, from the two-volume
history of the movement through the nineteenth century, *A Social History
of the Churches of Christ* (1966, 1973), to his more recent book on Homer
Hailey and the Churches of Christ in the twentieth century (2000).
Reading the first volumes years ago, I concluded that they exemplified
how denominational history should be done---emphasizing not triumphalism,
but social and cultural context. Hughes concurs, noting that Harrell
writes even-handedly about internecine controversies in which he was a
player.

Charles Reagan Wilson echoes others who laud how Harrell found what
others ignored. Wilson emphasizes Harrell's insistence that social class
mattered as much as race in energizing southern religion. Besides his
histories of restorationism, Harrell's early *White Sects and Black Men
in the Recent South* (1971) expanded the boundaries of what got included
in southern religious history. Harrell refused to refract southern
religion solely through the lens of evangelicalism.

In his essay, Scott Billingsley moves beyond Harrell's interest in
Pentecostalism, race, and class adding an emphasis on gender in
discussing Kenneth Hagin and his "Word of Faith" movement. Hagin did not
attract media hype like Oral Roberts, but, Billingsley demonstrates, he
left a deep imprint on popular Pentecostalism, influencing especially
African American and female preachers. The Word of Faith's "prosperity
gospel" empowered both blacks and women to jettison race and gender
bias. In addition, the thousands linked through Hagin's Rhema Bible
Training Center offer a cognate to the Churches of Christ---a
"non-denomination" with the trappings of a nascent institution.

How the Churches of Christ function without denominational apparatus
informs John Hardin's discussion of B. C. Goodpasture. Analysts often
suggest that the Churches of Christ has maintained structures holding
the movement together, especially colleges and campus lectureships.
Periodicals have also been vital. Hardin portrays Goodpasture, editor of
the influential Churches of Christ *Gospel Advocate* from 1939 to 1977, as
the effective power broker within a movement eschewing formal authority.
Authors of articles carried his unofficial imprimatur of orthodoxy,
while those aligned with other publications might not speak the Truth.

The final piece, by Dwain Waldrep, examines how northern fundamentalism
infiltrated what became the Bible Belt. Using tools similar to those
Harrell applied to the post-war healing revivals, he shows how the Bible
conference movement, and then a network anchored in Dallas Theological
Seminary, planted millenarianism in the region, succeeding in part
because southern millenarianism had no "siege mentality."

Drawn to figures and movements on the margins of American---especially
southern--- religious life, Ed Harrell took the presumably peripheral and
showed how important it really was. These essays testify to how
groundbreaking his work remains. Together they tell a story of one who
is mentor, friend, and scholar par excellence.
