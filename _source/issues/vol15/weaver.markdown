*Domestic Slavery* is a collection of letters written by two leading
Baptists from the middle of the nineteenth century: Richard Fuller, a
South Carolinian pastor, and Francis Wayland, President of Brown
University and leading northern Baptist statesman. They engaged in a
literary debate over slavery from 1844 to 1845 in the pages of a Boston,
Massachusetts newspaper, the *Christian Reflector*. The debate over
slavery was intense beyond Baptist circles, of course. But Baptists
split in May 1845 over slavery, and specifically, over whether a mission
sending agency would appoint a slaveholder.

Many elements that one would expect in a religious discussion of slavery
are in the letters. Fuller relies on the "plain" literal reading of the
Bible to defend the practice of slavery (152). Like his predecessor from
South Carolina, Richard Furman, Fuller contends that the apostles would
have surely criticized slavery if it was immoral. Utilizing a typical
Baptist (and restorationist) primitivist hermeneutic, Fuller notes that
Baptists simply adhered to the New Testament pattern of apostolic
practice. He moreover charged anti-slavery advocates with willingly
abandoning biblical authority. In perhaps the best line of the exchange,
Fuller tells Wayland that the northerner's position requires a
"laborious, up-hill, Sisyphus-task, of overcoming the word of God"
(117).

For his own part, Wayland assumes a "moderate," or gradualist,
perspective on emancipation. Like Fuller, he criticizes immediate
emancipation, reasoning that slaves were not prepared for freedom. He
additionally suggests that abolitionist fanaticism was the cause of the
"universal irritability" of southerners (17). As for scripture, Wayland
advocates a "progressive revelation" reading of the text. In the New
Testament, Wayland finds evidence that Christians should follow biblical
"principles" and individual conscience rather than "precepts." In this
way, the Golden Rule and "to love neighbor as yourself" trump any
literal application of specific slavery passages to the nineteenth
century (56, 70).

The exchange of letters draws a picture of two statesmen who admired and
respected each other, and they occasionally found common ground. Fuller
made multiple attempts to say that slavery in every case is not sin;
Wayland would agree. Where criticisms appear, they are carefully
crafted.. Fuller tells Wayland that the abolitionists will take
advantage of him because of his understanding of scripture. Wayland
tells Fuller that he is na√Øve---his focus on the benefits of slavery for
slaves belied the corruption and abuses that Fuller seems to deny. Their
rhetoric reveals that they do not want their regions/denomination to
split, even though Fuller predicted that abolitionism will cause a
rupture.

Finn and Harper's edition of *Domestic Slavery* provides helpful
annotations to the text. Ten letters are from Wayland; six are from
Fuller. My only wish is that the editors---both perceptive
historians---would have provided a more in-depth introduction. Still,
their purpose was to provide this "classic" primary source to
contemporary readers. Mercer University Press---which has previously
published other editions of primary sources by Harper (of Southern
Baptist missions icons, Lottie Moon and and Annie Armstrong)---is to be
commended for providing these resources. As a primary source collection,
I have used the book in a graduate seminar on Baptists of the period.
The letters of Wayland and Fuller are a good and fascinating read and as
the editors indicated, an illustration of how two public figures
differed on a volatile topic without impugning each other's character.
*Domestic Slavery* is also, as it should be for readers today, a
troubling read.
