Wallace Hettle's *Inventing Stonewall Jackson* illuminates less about the
history of the Confederate general,and more about his memory. Jackson,
who died of wounds received at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May
1863, left few records that allow historians to take his "measure as a
man" (4). Jackson did not allow newspaper reporters in his camp and
wrote a relatively scant number of wartime personal letters. Scholars
instead rely upon memoir and biography to explore his personal
character. For these reasons, Hettle intends "not to provide a
definitive interpretation of the authentic Jackson but to use memoir and
biography to understand both southern culture and the subjective element
of biography" (9).

Hettle organizes his book into chapters on various authors, mostly
southern, who wrote about Jackson from the war years to the early
twentieth century. Chapter 1 examines wartime writings on Jackson.
Northern and southern newspapers and biographies portrayed Jackson in
admiring terms, while soldiers in their private letters more frequently
criticized Jackson's character quirks. Northern writers sometimes
identified Jackson as a religious fanatic. Southern writers, on the
other hand, usually regarded him as an ordinary pious Christian. Chapter
2 explores Robert Lewis Dabney's authorized biography, arguing that the
book's emphasis on martyrdom and modernity reflected the author's "vexed
relationship to antebellum society, progress, and the war" (28). Dabney
presented Jackson as a soldier who drew upon the authority of God and
upon the ethics of individualism, self-discipline, and personal
achievement to fight for his country. Chapter 3 centers on John Esten
Cooke's biography, which portrayed Jackson as an eccentric hero for the
Confederate cause. Cooke's stories of Jackson's peculiarities, though
embellished and even invented, became enduring components of the Jackson
mythology. Chapter 4 turns to Anna Jackson's biography of her deceased
husband. Jackson's portrait painted him as loving family man, a
representation practically non-existent prior to the publication of her
biography. Chapter 5 addresses memoirs written by common soldiers and
officers who served under Jackson, which highlight Jackson's paradoxical
and complicated character. Chapter 6 uncovers the work of Mary Johnston,
the Virginia suffrage advocate whose critical account of Jackson as
characterized by harshness and cruelty emerged from her interpretation
of the war as fraught with hardship and suffering. Chapter 7 features
the work of Allen Tate, the southern poet and literary critic. The
chapter charts Tate's initial embrace and later rejection of Lost Cause
romanticism. An epilogue skips over historical biographies of the late
twentieth century to highlight the film *Gods and Generals*, a
reconciliationist take on the war that centers on Jackson as the main
character.

Written in an accessible manner, *Inventing Stonewall Jackson* will appeal
to a broad audience. Those interested in historical memory and southern
literature will be especially interested in the book. Readers of this
journal might particularly appreciate Hettle's brief attention to
representations of Jackson's religiosity, specifically his discussions
of fanaticism, martyrdom, and blasphemy.

Hettle's work joins a growing body of scholarship that analyzes the
memory of the Civil War. Hettle's foray fits squarely within a subset of
this scholarship that concerns Civil War officers in history and memory,
including Gary Gallagher's *Lee and His Generals in War and Memory*
(1998), Carol Reardon's Pickett's *Charge in History and Memory* (1997),
and Joan Waugh's *U. S. Grant: American Hero, American Myth* (2009), among
others. One of Hettle's most significant contributions is to place
memoirists' and biographers' publications on Jackson in the context of
their other writings, allowing him to explore influences on their
portrayals of the Confederate general. As Hettle remarks, "Writers on
Jackson reveal themselves as much as they do their ostensible subject"
(8). Equally valuable, the book collects several of Hettle's previously
published articles, and their revision into a single volume reveals the
evolution of the Jackson persona as a patriotic martyr, eccentric hero,
loving patriarch, and harsh disciplinarian. Much of this lore, as Hettle
notes, continues to influence historians' biographies of Jackson today.
