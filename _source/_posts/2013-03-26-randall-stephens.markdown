In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] talks with [Randall Stephens][], who
was the keynote speaker for the sixth annual [North American
Undergraduate Conference in Religion and Philosophy][], held at Saint
Francis University. Stephens's address was entitled, "Evangelical
Anti-Intellectualism in Modern America," which draws from his book,
*[The Anointed: Evangelical Truth in a Secular Age][]*, co-authored with
Karl Giberson. Stephens is Reader in History and American Studies at
Northumbria University in the UK, and he is a former editor of the
*Journal of Southern Religion*. Stephens begins the conversation by
explaining how his keynote will contribute to the conference's theme,
"The Future of Reason." He also talks about the book's research, which
includes interviews with David Barton and leaders of Focus on the
Family. The interview concludes with Stephens discussing his newest
project, an examination of rock music and American Christianity.
