In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] talks with [Michael Sean Winters][]
about his new book, [*God's Right Hand: How Jerry Falwell Made God a
Republican and Baptized the American Right*][book]. Winters writes for the
[National Catholic Reporter][], where he also blogs at ["Distinctly
Catholic."][] During this conversation, Winters first explains what
compelled him to write this biography. He then discusses Falwellâ€™s early
career, his rise to political prominence, his curious friendships with
the likes of Larry Flynt, and his "mixed" legacy as it relates to
American religious and political culture.
