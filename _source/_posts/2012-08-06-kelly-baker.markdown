In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] speaks with [Kelly Baker][] about her
new book, [*Gospel According to the Klan: The Ku Klux Klan's Appeal to
Protestant America, 1915--1930*][book]. Baker teaches religious studies and
American studies at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. During
this conversation, Baker discusses how she used ethnographic and
historical methods to examine the print culture of this "unloved group."
She also talks about how and why the Klan translated its identity
through a Protestant lens in their time, and where similar rhetorical
constructions of nationalism, nativism, and intolerance appear today.
This podcast originates from the annual meeting of the [Society for
Values in Higher Education][].
