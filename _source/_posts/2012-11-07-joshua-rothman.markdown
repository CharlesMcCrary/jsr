In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] speaks with [Joshua Rothman][] about
his new book *[Flush Times and Fever Dreams: A Story of Capitalism and
Slavery in the Age of Jackson][book]*. Professor Rothman is an associate
professor of history at the University of Alabama and the director of
the [Summersell Center for the Study of the South][]. During this
conversation, Rothman recounts the fascinating story of Virgil Stewart
and John Murrell, as well as the gruesome details of Mississippiâ€™s
notorious wave of violence in the summer of 1835. He also reflects on
how his research might raise valuable questions for scholars of southern
religion.
