In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] talks with [Mike Pasquier][] and
[Doug Thompson][] about changes happening at the *Journal of Southern
Religion*. Pasquier, Remillard, and [Luke Harlow][] are all stepping
down from their respective positions at the *JSR*. In their places,
Thompson will assume the journalâ€™s editorial duties, and [Carolyn
Dupont][] will handle book reviews and podcasts. Meanwhile, [Emily
Clark][] will evolve in her role as managing editor, and [Lincoln
Mullen][] and [Matt Cromwell][] will continue developing the website. In
their discussion, Pasquier and Thompson talk about all of these
transitions, while also considering the past, present, and future of the
*JSR*.
