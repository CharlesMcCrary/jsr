The *Journal of Southern Religion* has been [open access][] since its
first issue in 1998, meaning that anyone could read the journal for free
online. This kind of [open access][] is sometimes called *gratis open
access*.

But now the *JSR* has increased its commitment to [open access][] by
releasing all of its content under the [Creative Commons Attribution
license][cc]. This means the journal is explicitly granting its users
permission to copy, distribute, and use the journal in any way that you
see fit. The kind of [open access][] is sometimes called *libre open
access*. For example, if you wanted to include an article in a course
pack or a collection of essays, you now have permission to do so. The
primary requirement is that you attribute the work to the author and
journal. Of course, professional standards about fair use and citation
still apply. For a fuller explanation you can see our [policies][] page.
