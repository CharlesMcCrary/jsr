In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] talks with [Christopher Graham][]
about his article in [Volume 15][] of the *JSR*, "[Evangelicals and
'Domestic Felicity' in the Non-Elite South][]." Graham just completed
his doctorate in history at the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro. The discussion begins with Graham talking about how this
article grew out of his broader interest in the lives of "common people"
in the Civil War era. He then describes the evangelical print culture of
the era and its influence on domestic life in Piedmont North Carolina.
Graham concludes by thinking about how the "evangelical domestic ethos"
forged in the 1850s might complicate our understanding of secession and
Confederate nationhood.
