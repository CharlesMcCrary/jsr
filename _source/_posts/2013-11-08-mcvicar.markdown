In this episode, [Art Remillard][] talks with [Michael McVicar][] about
his article in [Volume 15][] of the JSR, "[Take Away the Serpents from
Us: The Sign of Serpent Handling and the Development of Southern
Pentecostalism][]." McVicar is an assistant professor of religion at
Florida State University. The podcast begins with McVicar explaining how
he became interested in this topic. He then offers an overview of the
discussions and debates about serpent handling practices among early
pentecostals. McVicar concludes by reflecting on the ways that his essay
sheds light on how we contextualize and interpret marginal religious
practices more broadly.
