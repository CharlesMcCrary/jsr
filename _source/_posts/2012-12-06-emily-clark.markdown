In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] speaks with [Emily Clark][] about her
article in [volume 14][] of the *Journal of Southern Religion*. Clark is a
doctoral candidate at Florida State University and managing editor of
the JSR. In this conversation, she brings us back to 1973, when a group
of professors in the Religion Department at FSU established the Center
for the Study of Southern Religion and Culture. For the next eight
years, the Center held lectures and symposia and published The Bulletin
of the Center of the Study of Southern Religion and Culture. Clark
explains how reading through this "time capsule of southern religion"
helped her to better understand the historiography, while also offering
context for her [dissertation][], "The Creole Color Line: Religion and
Race in Nineteenth Century New Orleans." This is the second of three
podcasts recorded at the annual meeting of the American Academy of
Religion in Chicago.
