In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] speaks with [Maura Jane Farrelly][]
about her new book, *[Papist Patriots: The Making of an American
Catholic Identity][]*. Farrelly is Assistant Professor of American
Studies at Brandeis University, where she also directs the Journalism
Program. During this conversation, Farrelly discusses how Catholics in
colonial Maryland came to accept what Jesuit theologian John Courtney
Murray has called the "American consensus." However, unlike Murray who
stressed the role of natural law theology, *Papist Patriots* examines
the unique and complicated experiences of Catholics in the colony.
Farrelly concludes with a reflection on how her work---to include her
JSR article, "[Catholics in the Early South][]"---might influence the
broader telling of southern religious history.
