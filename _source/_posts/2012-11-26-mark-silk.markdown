In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] speaks with [Mark Silk][] about religion and the 2012 presidential election. Silk is Professor of Religion in Public life at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, and director of the [Leonard E. Greenberg Center][] for the Study of Religion in Public Life. Among his many publications, Silk co-edited an eight-volume [series][] on religion and region, which culminated in his 2008 book, *[One Nation, Divisible][]*, co-authored with [Andrew Walsh][]. Silk also blogs at "[Spiritual Politics][]," which is hosted by the [Religion News Service][]. In this conversation, Silk begins by discussing his unique career path, from a doctorate in medieval history at Harvard, to the *Atlanta Journal-Constitution*, and then back to academia. He goes on to offer insight on the major themes of the presidential race, such as the gaining influence of the religiously unaffiliated (or "[nones][]"), Mitt Romney's Mormonism, and the possible declining influence of the "evangelical vote." This is the first of three podcasts recorded at the annual meeting of the [American Academy of Religion][] in Chicago.
