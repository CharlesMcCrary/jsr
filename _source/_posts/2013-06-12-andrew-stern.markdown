In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] talks with [Andrew Stern][] about his
new [book][], *Southern Crucifix, Southern Cross: Catholic-Protestant
Relations in the Old South*. Stern is an assistant professor of religion
at North Carolina Wesleyan College. In this discussion, he explains how
Catholics and Protestants in the Old South formed bonds that allowed
them to heal, learn, worship, and rule together. Stern concludes by
thinking about how his book contributes to both Catholic history and
southern religious history.
