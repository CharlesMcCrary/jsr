Among the many highlights of this year's southeastern regional meeting
of the [American Academy of Religion][] was a panel review of Charles
Reagan Wilson's *[Flashes of a Southern Spirit: Meanings of the Spirit
in the U.S. South][]*. In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] talks with
[Professor Wilson][] as well as two of the panelists, [Anne Blue
Wills][] of Davidson College and [Rodger Payne][] of UNC-Ashville.
Wilson is Kelly Gene Cook Senior Chair of History and Professor of
Southern Studies at the University of Mississippi. He is the author of
*[Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865-1920][]* and
co-editor of *[The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture][]*. In this
discussion, the panelists consider how Wilson's focus on "the spirit"
might be used in analyzing everything from southern stereotypes on
reality television to the unique religious culture of Italian Catholics
in the region. Wilson concludes the conversation, reflecting on what the
reviewers taught him about "the spirit."
