In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] talks with [Patrick Mason][] about
his new book, [*The Mormon Menace: Violence and Anti-Mormonism in the
Postbellum South*][]. Mason is the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at
Claremont Graduate University. During this conversation, Mason explains
what initially drew him to this unique project, which represents a
significant contribution to both southern religious history and Mormon
history. He offers insights into how he conceptualized violence to frame
his narrative, and how anti-Mormonism differed from the prejudices faced
by Jews and Catholics. Mason also looks ahead, discussing future
projects and sharing his thoughts on what Mitt Romneyâ€™s candidacy might
mean for Mormons in the South and nationally.

\[Mason's book was [reviewed in volume 13] of the *JSR*.\]
