In the JSR's first podcast, [Art Remillard][] interviews [Paul Harvey][]
about his new book, *[Moses, Jesus, and the Trickster in the Evangelical
South][].* Professor Harvey discusses a range of topics, from his
experiences at the Lamar Lectures in Southern History at Mercer
University, to his unique collection of sources. (He recently uploaded
some of the book’s [folk art images to his website][].) He also explains
his decision to frame the book as a “throwback to an earlier kind of
religious history that centered on Protestantism and marginalized other
traditions.” Paul qualifies that it is a “throwback” only insofar as the
book examines the evangelical majority. Otherwise, as he explains, this
“center” is quite complex, particularly on matters of race.
