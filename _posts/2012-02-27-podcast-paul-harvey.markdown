This past Friday, I had the pleasure of recording the first *JSR*
podcast, an interview with [Paul Harvey](http://paulharvey.org/)
about his new book, *[Moses, Jesus, and the Trickster in the Evangelical
South](http://www.ugapress.org/index.php/books/index/moses_jesus_and_the_trickster).*
Lincoln is working on getting us on iTunes, but in the meantime, you can
download the podcast
[here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/40661100/harvey02242012.mp3). 

Paul and I covered a range of topics, from his experiences at the Lamar
Lectures in Southern History at Mercer University, to his unique
collection of sources. (He recently uploaded some of the book's [folk
art images to his website](http://paulharvey.org/moses/).) We also
discussed his decision to frame the book as a "throwback to an earlier
kind of religious history that centered on Protestantism and
marginalized other traditions." Long story short, it's a "throwback"
only insofar as it examines the evangelical majority. Otherwise, as he
explains, this "center" is quite complex, particularly on matters of
race. Despite his nuanced response, I pounced on the opportunity to
[shamelessly self-promote my own
book](http://www.ugapress.org/index.php/books/southern_civil_religions/),
which does examine "other traditions." But I don't claim that they were
on equal footing. That would be, as Paul put it, "flat not true." 

So we hope that you enjoy the podcast. With any luck, there will be many
more in the future!
