Historians have long recognized the prominence of the Protestant church
within the African American community, from its "invisible"
institutional origins under slavery to its conspicuous leadership in the
civil rights era. In her book, Angela Hornsby-Gutting assumes an
acquaintance with this fact as she seeks to expand the gendered analysis
of black community development in the Jim Crow South. Focusing
specifically on the role black *men* played in this process, the author
rectifies a perceived oversight in the historical literature, which
typically emphasizes black men's activity in the political arena and
black women's roles in community development. In her analysis of black
men within the church, fraternal orders, and community institutions,
Hornsby-Gutting sheds long overdue light upon their pivotal role in
negotiating gender constructions and racial uplift in the face of white
racial discrimination and black class and gender division.

The author begins this analysis by examining black churchmen and their
reactions to the "Black Women's Era" in which black women, much like
white women of the period, assumed more assertive roles within the
church and community. In her first chapter, Hornsby-Gutting recognizes
how Jim Crow segregation statutes, disfranchisement legislation, and
lynch law all politically unmanned black men. She also acknowledges the
rising tide of white racial prejudice, highlighting the gendered means
by which whites denigrated black women as licentious while castigating
black men as bestial. Through her examination of various denominational
convention meetings, the author emphasizes the precarious balancing act
performed by African American churchmen. In her view, these men sought
to combat white prejudice by subscribing to prevailing Victorian gender
conventions, which idealized masculine restraint and feminine virtue
while also asserting their masculine prerogatives of female protector
and community leader. Toeing this line proved difficult. External
prejudice and oppression combined with internal class conflict and
gender dissension to frustrate male efforts to control female community
activity *and* promote racial solidarity. These dueling motives pervade
all subsequent issues.

The second chapter explicates the "boy problem" prevalent in all
evangelical denominations of the period. The feminization of religion
and society---symptoms of the modern industrial economy---figured
prominently in the minds of many whites and blacks. Their proposed
solution, typically identified as "Muscular Christianity," was to
recruit more young men into the church by emphasizing recreational
pursuits as important to both spiritual development and masculine
maturation. Among African Americans, this pursuit involved similar
contestation between feminine assertion and masculine control, racial
uplift and gender hierarchy that shaped debates over church policy.
Chapter three follows these debates into African American fraternal
orders---especially the Prince Hall Masons---highlighting the discord
between these all-male spaces and their auxiliary female organizations
as both groups engaged in racial uplift activities such as education and
economic relief. The final chapter documents how these debates evolved
over time by focusing on Emancipation Day celebrations and "colored"
state fairs, paying particular attention to the role and function of
Asheville's Young Men's Institute (YMI---a local organization similar to
the YMCA). She argues convincingly that the younger generations
increasingly rejected attempts to assuage white prejudicial fears in
favor of direct resistance to discrimination and forceful assertion of
black manhood and racial pride.

Hornsby-Gutting situates her work squarely within the rubric of southern
gender and race relations. She brings a substantive discussion of
postbellum black manhood to the insights pioneered by Gail Bederman,
Kathleen Clark, Laura Edwards, Glenda Gilmore, and Tera Hunter, among
others, who focus predominantly upon black women. Moreover, by relating
religious developments to Jim Crow legislation, class conflict, and
Victorian gender conventions, Hornsby-Gutting pushes the discussion of
black masculinity beyond the purely political, while also placing the
black church and its community function within the broader narrative of
American imperialism.

Several works seem conspicuously absent from Hornsby-Gutting's
notes---Kristin Hoganson's *Fighting for American Manhood*(1998), Clifford
Putney's *Muscular Christianity*(2001), and Ted Ownby's *Subduing
Satan*(1990)*---*all of which might have enhanced her related perspectives
on the gendered dynamics of imperialism, religion, and recreation.
Scholars seeking an in-depth treatment of the theological and
institutional development of African American religion---or evangelicalism
generally---in the period should look elsewhere. But those interested in
the gendered dimensions of the black church within the black community,
the Jim Crow South, and the imperial age will find impressive rewards
herein.
